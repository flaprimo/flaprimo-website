The master thesis project gave me the opportunity for a trip in Rio de Janeiro.
My brazilian friends Isis and Renato hosted me for one of my greatest trip ever, letting me understand the beauty and the culture of Brazil and Carioca's way of life.
Being there during the presidential elections of 2018, was an added value to better understand the actual brazilian socio-economical situation.
