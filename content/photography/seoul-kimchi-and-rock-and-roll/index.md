A culture of contrasts between east and west, monarchy and democracy, joy and sorrow, war and peace, clubbing and work, but surely of kind people and spicy food.

I'm really grateful that the [paper I published](https://flavioprimo.xyz/blog/a-customisable-pipeline-for-continuously-harvesting-socially-minded-twitter-user/) at [ICWE 2019](https://icwe2019.webengineering.org/) gave me the opportunity to visit this wonderful country and to meet old and new friends.

Photos of Daejeon and [KAIST](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAIST) are missing, my bad.
