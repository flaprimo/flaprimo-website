"Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.

I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post.

I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."
