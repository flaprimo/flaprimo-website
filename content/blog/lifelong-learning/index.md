**Lifelong Learning** is the concept of ["ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated"](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED471201.pdf) pursuit of knowledge for any reason.

I've finished my formal University path, but it does not mean that I stopped learning, I am currently enrolled in a second level master in Cloud Data Architecture at [Cefriel - Politecnico di Milano](https://www.cefriel.com/en).

Other than that, I am learning on my own on other online and offline platform on a path of personal enrichment, I will try my best to share and keep my notes updated.

Of course errors will be present, so if you find any please tell me (a comment is fine), and I'll try to correct them.

If you like my notes please consider **[buying me a beer](https://www.paypal.me/flaprimo)** (in person is even more appreciated :)), happy study!
